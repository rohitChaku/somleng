```

Setup the Instance for usage:
```
apt update
apt install curl libpcre2-posix2 libpcre2-dev build-essential git postgresql nodejs vim screen iproute2 net-tools -y
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
apt install yarn -y
```

Setup and launch the application:
```
bundle config --local deployment true
bundle config --local path "vendor/bundle"
bundle config --local without 'development test'
bundle install --jobs 20 --retry 5
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
bundle exec rails assets:precompile
mkdir -p tmp/pids

# Start the application
# Necessary config changes can be made in config/app_settings.yml
bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb
```

### MacOS Setup
Prelimnary installation:
```
brew install yarn
brew install ruby # Ruby 3.1
brew install libpq # PostgreSQL Client
brew install pcre
```

```
export CPATH="/opt/homebrew/include:/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libpq/15.1/include:$CPATH"
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"
bundle config --local deployment true
bundle config --local path "vendor/bundle"
bundle config --local without 'development test'
bundle install --jobs 20 --retry 5
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
bundle exec rails assets:precompile
mkdir -p tmp/pids

## Deployment

The [infrastructure directory](https://github.com/somleng/somleng/tree/develop/infrastructure) contains [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration files in order to deploy Somleng to AWS.

:warning: Our infrastructure is rapidly changing as we continue to improve and experiment with new features. We often make breaking changes to the infrastructure which usually requires some manual migration. We don't recommend that you try to deploy and run your own Somleng stack for production purposes at this stage.
